# hello-world
Basic repository 
I almost fail to write this comment to branch. I walked around and then landed on master branch.
Without reviewing the branch I went to README.md file and start editing it. Luckly I got the issue and
now I am editing the right branch file. (branch: readme-edits, file: README.md)

"Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red."

Lost in translation. When reading "Pull Request", I imagine 'Pull' the 'Request'. Reviewing the text in website
'Pull Request' is asking someone to pull the code, review it, and if s/he like it, merge it.
